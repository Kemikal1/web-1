	Jared Slingerland
	</div>
	 Jared Slingerland (born January 16, 1984) is a Canadian guitarist and electronic musician based in
	 Vancouver, British Columbia.
	 He is best known as a member of the electro-industrial band Front Line Assembly (FLA) and his vocal
	 opposition to ketchup on kraft dinner.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 Slingerland began playing various instruments[example needed] in his
	 early teen years, ultimately excelling with the guitar. In his late
	 teenage years, Slingerland formed a goth nu metal project, called Ms.
	 Anne Thropy. Producer Jeremy Inkel later joined the project and the two
	 worked together in his home studio. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Anne Thropy
	 disbanded. Inkel and Slingerland continued to write music together for
	 various projects (including a trip hop project)
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 In late 2005, he began working with Front Line Assembly in the studio and was
	 eventually asked to tour with the band in support of the Artificial Soldier album.
	 After leaving Left Spine Down in 2008, Slingerland continues to tour North America
	 and Europe extensively as well as contributing writing/production for such albums as
	 Improvised Electronic Device, AirMech, Echogenetic and more.
