        Front Line Assembly (FLA) celebrated its third decade in the music industry last year in 2016. Since then the company has gone through many 
		changes. That includes different sounds and members. For example, band members like Michael Balch and Rhys Fulber have played in FLA and 
		several other bands during their musical history. This shows the big influence the band has had on the genre.
         </p><p>

		goal is to provide fresh and detailed information so you can better appreciate the band in terms of its past/present members, changes in
