	Jeremy Inkel
	</div>
	 Jeremy Inkel (8 February 1983 â€“ 11 January 2018) was a Canadian
	 electronic musician based in Vancouver. He was best known as a
	 keyboard player and programmer for Left Spine Down (LSD) and electro-industrial
	 band Front Line Assembly (FLA) as well as producing tracks for various well known
	 musicians worldwide.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	By 2003, Inkel co-founded Left Spine Down with kAINE D3L4Y and Matt Girvan.
	Their like-mindedness for punk rock and electronic music brought them together, performing
	as headliners as well as openers for touring acts in Vancouver. After beginning work on LSD's
	first album, Fighting for Voltage with Chris Peterson, Inkel was welcomed into Front Line Assembly in 2005.
	He co-wrote and -produced the full-length album Artificial Soldier (released in 2006).
	FLA then brought Inkel (as well as LSD alumni Jared Slingerland) on tour to promote the
	Artificial Soldier album.
