	 Leeb began his musical career with industrial band Skinny
	 Puppy in 1985 under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder,
	 contributing bass synth and occasional backing vocals to a
	 few of their recordings and concerts. He left in mid 1986 and
	 formed his own industrial project Front Line Assembly with
	 Michael Balch, and later Rhys Fulber and Chris Peterson.
	 Though Front Line Assembly has had consistent underground
	 success, Leeb's most widely known efforts are through his
	 side project, Delerium, which had a major hit in the late
	 1990s with "Silence". Leeb composed the soundtrack to the
	 1999 video game, Quake III Arena, of which the expansion pack,
	 Team Arena, was composed by his band, Front Line Assembly.
